# Hi, I'm Carlos! ✨

I'm a software developer! I mainly work with Python and TypeScript. That's all you really need these days, right?

Look at what else I can do:

- 📚 Study Informatics at the [University of California, Irvine](https://informatics.uci.edu/)
- 🤝🏽 Lead a research project in the [Undergraduate Research Lab](https://markbaldw.in/url/)
- 🦢 Develop software for [Black Swan 3D Printing](https://blackswan3d.com/)
- 🤔 ... and probably more!
