# Carlos Valdez (*@calejvaldez*)

Hi! I'm a full-stack developer focused on building reliable, human-centered apps
with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. I recently graduated with a B.S. in
Informatics, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. I care deeply about
usability and interface design, and have led agile teams, set up CI/CD
pipelines, and secured funding for a UCI research project. I'm always learning
from others and open to new ideas. Let's connect about full-stack roles or
collaborative projects!
